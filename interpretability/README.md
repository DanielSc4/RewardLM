# Interpretability analysis

##### Implementation of analysis using the [🐛Inseq](https://github.com/inseq-team/inseq) intrepretability library.

The script `gen_attribute.py` generate the attribuition for a subsample of sentences. The goal is to compare the [low, high] toxicity responses produced by the fine-tuned and RLAF generative models, comparing them to the [low, high] responses by the original pretrained model.

Usage:

```bash
echo "Hello, world!"    # todo
```
